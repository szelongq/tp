HeRon is a desktop application for HR managers of Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to assist them in managing HR administrative tasks such as tracking leaves and offs, calculating pay and updating payroll information. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a fast typer, HeRon can get your tasks done faster as compared to traditional GUI apps.

This User Guide will bring you through the features that HeRon has to offer, as well as the commands to make use of them.

## Entering Commands
Commands can be inputted into the Command Box to get HeRon to perform an operation.
Commands can be divided into separate components, each serving different purposes. Depending on the format of the command,
they may or may not use all components. Below shows an example of a command with its various components:

![CommandFormat](images/user-guide/CommandFormat.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Please read this information panel for more information on commands before proceeding.**

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a field which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `i.e. []` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a field is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the field will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## Commands

### General Admin Commands

#### Import Data from CSV files: `import`

HeRon assists you in starting by making it easy to migrate from other software, such as Excel. To transfer your existing data, convert it into a Comma Separated Value (.csv) file. If you require help in exporting your spreadsheet in Excel to a .csv file, you can refer to this [guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-a-workbook-to-text-format-txt-or-csv-3e9a9d6c-70da-4255-aa28-fcacf1f081e6_) by Microsoft.

This command then allows you to migrate the data in the csv file that you have, replacing the existing data in HeRon.

**Format:** `import FILEPATH`
* Filepath Requirements
  * You should only specify **ONE** `FILEPATH`, which can be absolute or relative.
  * Write the filepath following your devices' Operating System. (e.g. `\My Folder\myData.csv` for Windows; `/My Folder/myData.csv` for MacOS/Linux).
<br><br>
* Formatting Requirements
  * Use the first row in the .csv file as the header row to indicate the purpose of the various fields.
  * Ensure that the header rows of the respective fields are labelled according to the naming convention in the table below.
  * There is no specific requirement for ordering of the columns.
  * Ensure that the number of fields in each entry matches the number of headers.
<br><br>
* Data Requirements
  * Ensure all entries have data in the compulsory fields, listed in the table below.
  * Ensure that each field follows the specifications required, which you can find in the [Command Format Table](UserGuide.md#command-format-table).
  * HeRon prevents you from importing data if an entry has the same `Name`, `Email` or `Contact Number` as another entry.
  * Separate your data's tag field with `/` if multiple tags are present.
  * If you provide a value for a non-compulsory field for at least one entry, you must also provide the respective values for all other entries. On the other hand, if you do not provide data for the field, it would be set to the default value for all entries.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Take note: If there are multiple instances of duplicated/missing/incorrect data, HeRon will only notify you of the first row has errors present.
</div>

**Field Naming Requirements and Default Values**

--------------|---------------|------------------------ | --------
`NAME`|Name|**Yes**| N.A.
`PHONE_NUMBER` |Contact Number|**Yes**| N.A.
`ADDRESS` |Residential Address|**Yes**| N.A.
`EMAIL` |Email|**Yes**| N.A.
`ROLE` |Role|**Yes**| N.A.
`NUMBER_OF_LEAVES` |Leave Balance|No | 0
`HOURLY_SALARY` |Salary|No | 0.00
`HOURS_WORKED` |Hours Worked|No | 0
`OVERTIME` |Overtime|No | 0
`TAGS`|Tags|No| Empty Set of Tags

#### Viewing employee data: `view`

This command allows you to view the data of the specified employee at the InfoPanel.

**Format:** `view INDEX`
* Displays the data of the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the number next to an employee's name in the displayed employee list.

**Example:**
* `list` followed by `view 3` displays the information of the 3rd employee in the employee list.
* `find r/Financial Manager` followed by `view 1` displays the information of the 1st employee in the list of employees that have the Financial Manager role.

  ![Result of successful add](images/user-guide/addExample.png)
  _Result of adding a new employee Betsy successfully to HeRon_ <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing an employee : `edit`

Edits an existing employee in HeRon.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/ROLE] [l/NUMBER_OF_LEAVES] [s/HOURLY_SALARY] [hw/HOURS_WORKED] [o/OVERTIME] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
  The index refers to the number next to an employee's name in the displayed employee list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the employee will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the employee’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.
* The values you provide to the command must be valid. For information on which values are valid, you may refer to the [Command Table Format](UserGuide.md#command-format-table) for more information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Take note: The edit command is unable to directly edit the dates of leaves taken by employees.
Refer to the `assignLeave` and `removeLeavesBefore` commands below instead to edit the dates.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com l/15` Edits the phone number, email address and leaves of the 1st employee to be `91234567`, `johndoe@example.com` and `15` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd employee to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

#### Deleting an employee : `delete`

This command allows you to delete a specific employee from the application.


**Format:** `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the number next to an employee's name in the displayed employee list.

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd employee in HeRon.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Locating specific employees: `find`

Find employees using specified fields, checking if their information field contains any of the given keywords / queries.

**Format:** `find [STATUS] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/ROLE] [l/NUMBER_OF_LEAVES] [d/DATE] [s/HOURLY_SALARY] [hw/HOURS_WORKED] [o/OVERTIME] [t/TAG]...`

* At least one field should be specified.
* The order of the fields do not matter except for the `[STATUS]` field, which must come right after `find`.
* To search a field with multiple values, separate each value with a space after their respective tag.
  * Example: Use `find n/Alice Charlotte` to search for `Alice` or `Charlotte` in the `name` field.
* The filters work differently for each field and can be generalised to 4 types of queries, described below. A single find command can contain all 4 types of queries at once.<br>
  <br>
  * **Type 1 Query: Keyword Matching**
    * Fields: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ADDRESS`, `r/ROLE`, `t/TAG`
      * These fields will find all employees who contain the given keywords in their respective fields. They are not case-sensitive.
      * The exceptions are:
        * `p/PHONE` field, which only find exact matches.
        * `n/NAME` field, which can find matches when a complete part (first/middle/last) of a name is given. (e.g. For name "Charlotte Oliverio", both `n/Charlotte` and `n/Oliverio` works, but `n/Char` or `n/Oliver` will not)
    * For example, `find p/91234567 e/alice bob r/Admin` will find anyone who satisfies all the following 3 criteria:
      1. has the phone number 91234567,
      2. whose email contains `alice` or `bob`, and
      3. whose role contains `Admin`.<br>
  <br>
  * **Type 2 Query: Value Based Comparison**
    * Fields: `hw/HOURS_WORKED`, `l/NUMBER_OF_LEAVES`, `s/HOURLY_SALARY`, `o/OVERTIME`
      * These fields must be specified with a comparison and a value to compare the respective field to. Valid comparisons are
        * `>`: more than
        * `>=`: more than or equal to
        * `=`: equal to
        * `<`: less than
        * `<=`: less than or equal to

    * For example, `find hw/>=10 l/<7` will find anyone who satisfies the both of the following 2 criteria:
      1. has worked more than or exactly 10 hours, and
      2. has less than 7 days of leave left (e.g. 6 and below)

    * You cannot enter more than 1 comparison or value to compare to. For example, `find hw/<10 >5` is not valid.<br>
  <br>
  * **Type 3 Query: Status Based Filter**
    * There are no fields attached to this query. Instead, specific keywords are available for use.
      * These status keywords must be used right after `find` and cannot be used after a field is specified (for example `n/`).
      * Keywords available include:
        * `unpaid`
        * More to be added.
    * For example, `find unpaid` will find all employees who are considered unpaid.<br>
  <br>
  * **Type 4 Query: Date Based Comparison**
    * Fields: `d/DATE`
      * This field will find all people who have taken a leave on a given date or within a range of dates. (start and end dates inclusive)
      * There are two ways to search using dates: individual dates or date ranges.
        * For individual dates, simply type in a date of the form YYYY-MM-DD.
        * For date ranges, simply type in two dates in the form YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD.
      * Both individual dates and date ranges can be combined into one query.
    * For example, `find d/2021-10-10 2021-11-01:2021-11-05` will find anyone who satisfies **either** of the following 2 criteria:
      1. has taken a leave on October 10th 2021, or
      2. has taken a leave between the dates November 1st 2021 and November 5th 2021, start and end dates inclusive.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Examples:**
* `find unpaid n/John Mike r/admin l/<=5 o/>3` finds all employees who satisfy all the following criteria:
  1. is considered unpaid in the system,
  2. whose name is either John or Mike,
  3. whose role contains the word `admin`,
  4. has 5 or less than 5 leaves, and
  5. has strictly more than 3 days of overtime
* `find unpaid n/carl Elle l/<3` returns `Carl Kurz`, `Elle Meyer` as long as they have less than 3 leaves left and are still unpaid.<br>

* You must include at least one field (HOURS_WORKED or OVERTIME) when using the command.
* You can deduct work hours as well as overtime hours in the same command.  
* The index refers to the number next to an employee's name in the displayed employee list.
* The number of work/overtime hours to be deducted **must be between 1 and 744**: 1, 2, 3, …, 744
* You **cannot deduct more work/overtime hours than what the employee has.**

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `deductHoursWorked 2 hw/5 o/3` removes 5 hours worked and 3 hours of overtime from the 2nd employee in HeRon.
* `find n/Sam` followed by `deductHoursWorked 1 o/2` removes 2 hours of overtime from the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.

#### View the Overtime Pay Rate : `viewOvertimePayRate`

This command tells you the current overtime pay rate set in the application.

**Format:** `viewOvertimePayRate`

* Shows the current overtime pay rate in the Result Display.

#### Set a new Overtime Pay Rate : `setOvertimePayRate`

This command sets a new overtime pay rate to be used in payroll calculations.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Take note:
* You can only set the overtime pay rate to be a number from 1 to 10, and
* You can only enter up to 5 decimal places for the overtime pay rate.
</div>

**Format:** `setOvertimePayRate OVERTIME_PAY_RATE`

* This command sets the overtime pay rate in HeRon to `OVERTIME_PAY_RATE`.

**Examples:**
* `setOvertimePayRate 2.0` sets the new overtime pay rate to be 2.
* `setOvertimePayRate 0.5` would be invalid as `OVERTIME_PAY_RATE` must be at least 1.
* `setOvertimePayRate 1.000000` would also be invalid as there are more than 5 decimal places.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Start Payroll : `startPayroll`

This command calculates the payroll for all employees and marks them as unpaid.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Take note: Before using the command:
* You should not have any unpaid employees (in other words, no red 'NOT PAID' labels). Otherwise, an error will be thrown
  and no action will be taken.
* If you wish to start a new payroll, make sure to pay all employees using the [`pay`](#paying-employees--pay) command.
</div>

The formula for the pay of an employee is: <br>
<p align="center" markdown="1">

    `(HOURLY_SALARY x HOURS_WORKED) + (HOURLY_SALARY x OVERTIME x OVERTIME_PAY_RATE)`,

</p>

where `OVERTIME_PAY_RATE` is the added pay rate for overtime worked.<br>
It can be viewed through the [`viewOvertimePayRate`](#view-the-overtime-pay-rate--viewovertimepayrate) command 
or changed through the [`setOvertimePayRate`](#set-a-new-overtime-pay-rate--setovertimepayrate) command.

For example, if an employee has an hourly salary of $12/hr, 60 hours worked, 5 hours of overtime worked and 
the overtime pay rate is 1.5x, their pay would be:<br>
<p align="center"> ($12/hr x 60hrs) + ($12/hr x 5hrs x 1.5) = $720 + $90 = $810 </p>

**Format:** `startPayroll`
* This command will calculate the payroll and then show you the list of **all employees in HeRon, 
  regardless of the list you are currently viewing**.
* After that, for every employee who is owed some pay, they will have red labels saying `NOT PAID` and 
  how much they are owed.
* The number of Hours Worked and Overtime Hours Worked for the employee will also be **reset to 0**,
  so that you can continue to add hours towards the next payroll.
* After calculating the payroll, you can use the [`pay`](#paying-employees--pay) command to mark employees as paid,
  after their pay are given in real life.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example:**
* Before you use the `startPayroll` command, you might be viewing a filtered list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
  
* After entering the `startPayroll` command, the payroll will be calculated and you will then be viewing 
  the full list of employees. Each employee will have a red `NOT PAID` label.

#### Paying employee(s) : `pay`

This command has two formats:
* Format 1: `pay INDEX` - marks the employee at `INDEX` as paid.
* Format 2: `pay all` - marks all employees in the current list as paid

**Format 1:** `pay INDEX` - for marking a specific employee as paid
* This command marks the employee at `INDEX` as paid by removing the red `NOT PAID` label under the employee's data.
* The index refers to the number next to an employee's name in the displayed employee list.
* You can use this command after the [`startPayroll`](#start-payroll--startpayroll) command, 
  which calculates the payroll and marks all employees as unpaid.

**Example:**
* `pay 1` marks the 1st employee in the list as paid, removing the red `NOT PAID` label.
  ![before paying the employee](images/user-guide/pay_beforePaying.png)
  _Alex is marked as unpaid in HeRon after a `startPayroll` command_ <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

  ![after paying the employee](images/user-guide/pay_afterPaying.png)
  _After executing `pay 1`, Alex (being the 1st employee in this list) is marked as paid, 
  and the red `NOT PAID` label is removed_ <br>

**Format 2:** `pay all` - for marking all employees in the current list as paid
* This command marks all unpaid employees in the current list as paid by removing the red `NOT PAID` labels under 
  the employees' data.
* You can use this command after the [`startPayroll`](#start-payroll--startpayroll) command,
  which calculates the payroll and marks all employees as unpaid.
* If there are employees that are already paid in the list, they will be skipped and will be listed in 
  the feedback panel.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:<br>
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. 
It has a `Tag` and `Leave` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references.
This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, and one `Leave` object per unique date, 
instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` and `LeavesTaken` objects. More information on how leaves are currently implemented
can be found [here](#assigned-leaves). </div> 
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Command

**Current Implementation**

The find command allows a user to specify all the different fields which they want to search by.
It is implemented by parsing all the different fields that the user is searching with, and creating the relevant predicate for each field.
For example:
* Searching by name `n/NAME` will create a NameContainsKeywordsPredicate
* Searching by role `r/ROLE` will create a RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate
* Searching by overtime hours with a 'less than' comparison `o/<OVERTIME` will create a OvertimeLessThanPredicate

and so on.

Each field the user specifies is located and parsed with the `tokenize` function from ArgumentTokenizer.
The ArgumentTokenizer splits the user input into key-value pairs of the field's prefix and the values to query with, which can then be handled by the FindCommandParser.
Each predicate is then generated by passing the value found in the ArgumentMultimap created by ArgumentTokenizer.
In general, there are 2 main types of predicates.

1. Keyword matching predicates
    * These predicates check for a match between the user's query and the respective field in each `Person` in HeRon
    * The keywords are easily found from the ArgumentMultimap and are parsed using the `String#split()` method.

    One possible issue is that keywords containing spaces cannot be used. Therefore, a user input such as "Admin Assistant" will match "HR Assistant" and "IT Admin". 
    However, the current implementation allows for more flexible searching
   
2. Comparison based predicates
    * These predicates compare their given value with the respective field in each `Person` in HeRon.
        * For example, a LeaveLessThanPredicate will check if the `Person` has a number of leaves strictly less than the given value.
    * First, the respective method found in `FindCommandParser` for creating a comparison predicate is called.
        * For example, to get a `SalaryIsLessThanPredicate`, `FindCommandParser#getSalaryComparisonPredicate` is called with the user's input.
    * The comparison type is found using the `parseComparator()` method in FindCommandParser, which returns a CompareType, an enum found in FindCommandParser which has 5 values representing the different available comparisons: "more than", "more than or equal", "less than", "less than or equal", and "equal".
    * The value to compare to is then found using the `getComparisonValue()` method in FindCommandParser, which returns a String to be parsed.
        * This is done because the different fields take in different number types. For example, the HourlySalary field takes in a `double`, whereas the Leave field takes in an `int`.
    * Finally, the predicate is created by checking the CompareType and then passing the parsed value to the constructor.

After each predicate is generated, it is added to a list of filters in the parser, and after all predicates are added, they are combined into a single predicate using the `Predicate#reduce()` function, which is used to create the FindCommand.
This means that a Person must fulfill ALL predicates to be considered a match.
These predicates are combined into a single predicate so that it can be passed into the FindCommand, as it already takes in a single Predicate in its constructor.
This also means that the implementation of `FindCommand#execute()` does not need to be modified to account for multiple predicates at all, and it can be treated as a black box.

Below is the sequence diagram which shows a quick overview of how the FindCommand is created.
![FindCommand](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

![FindCommandGetPredicates](images/FindCommandGetPredicateDiagram.png)

This allows multiple types of predicates to be chained together so that it is possible to handle a large query with multiple filters.
Therefore, it is also easy to extend this implementation to contain other predicates by following the below steps.

1. Define a new Predicate class that implements Predicate<Person> that tests a certain field of a person.
2. Add that field's prefix into `CliSyntax.java` if it does not exist yet.
3. Add that field's prefix into `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` in `FindCommandParser#parse()`.
4. Within `FindCommandParser#parse()`, create the respective predicate and add it to the `filters` list in FindCommandParser.

**Alternatives considered**<br>
There are many alternatives for different parts of the FindCommandParser implementation.
The first alternative implementation concerns the predicate portion.

**Predicates**<br>
Modifying the code for `FindCommand#execute` to account for multiple predicates is very likely to cause errors. Therefore, it is much easier to find a way to combine predicates into a single one.
One alternative for combining predicates is to create a new `CombinedPredicate` class which contains all the possible fields to be compared with.

![CombinedPredicateExample](images/CombinedPredicateExample.png)
   
Using the `CombinedPredicate`, one can easily parse the user's command and create the appropriate `CombinedPredicate` to be passed into `FindCommand`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Pros:
* Easier to test for equality by comparing each field. This means it is easier to test if the FindCommandParser has parsed the user input correctly.

Cons:
* Harder to write the implementation for `CombinedPredicate#test()` as it requires checking for null values if the user does not query with that field.
* Will require a new field to be added every time a new field is added to `Person`, so that a user can filter by that field. Not as extensible compared to creating a new predicate and adding it to the chain.

##### Creating the comparison based predicates
Another place for consideration of alternative implementation is the implementation of the comparison based predicates such as `SalaryIsLessThanPredicate`.

This alternative involves combining all 5 types of comparison predicates (more than, more than or equal, less than, less than or equal, equal) into a single predicate (e.g. SalaryComparisonPredicate).
Then, the predicate will contain information of the type of comparison to make, and the value to compare to.

Pros:
* Less classes are needed to completely account for all 5 scenarios. (and possibly less repeated code)

Cons:
* Testing becomes harder because there are many branches to account for, since the `test()` method will change its behaviour based on the comparison type passed into it.
* May become less flexible if more types of comparisons are needed. The current implementation allows each predicate to be responsible for only one type of comparison.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Import Feature

**Current Implementation** <br>

The implemented import feature mechanism is facilitated by `ImportCommandParser`, `ImportCommand` and `PersonInput`. `ImportCommandParser` implements the interface `Parser`.`ImportCommand` extends abstract class `Command`, and implements the following additional operation:
* `ImportCommand#importData(Model)` Takes the filepath attributed to the ImportCommand and imports its content.

`PersonInput` is a class which stores the field inputs for a data entry as Strings, and implements getter and setter methods for all fields as required by the 3rd-party library opencsv. While parsing the csv file, `PersonInput` objects are created to consolidate all the information present, before being converted into `Person` objects and added into HeRon.

The fields `name`,`phone`, `address`, `email` and `role` must be present in all entries before the data can be imported successfully. This is to prevent junk data from being imported. These fields were selected as they are highly likely to be present in existing data to be used for import.

HeRon detects fields using column titles (first row of the csv file). Naming convention (case-insensitive) of the fields below must be followed to be detected, as per opencsv library requirements.
* `name` as Name
* `phone` as Contact Number
* `address` as Residential Address
* `email` as Email
* `role` as Role
   
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. HeRon initializes with the initial address book state or loaded with data from the previous session (if any).

**Step 2.** The user executes `import /toBeImported.csv` command to import the .csv file in the specified directory, which in this case, refers to the file `toBeImported.csv` in the root directory.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the specified directory is not valid, the command fails to complete and an error message is returned. There will be no changes made to the current AddressBook.</div>

**Step 3.** Program processes the .csv file. The first row is identified as the header row, which is used to determine which field of the PersonInput class the column represents. The remaining rows are parsed and PersonInput objects are created and added into a List. Once done, the List of PersonInput objects will be used to create a separate List of Person objects used to update the address book.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If there are entries with missing values in the required fields, the command fails to complete and an error message indicating the location of the error is returned. There will be no changes made to the current AddressBook.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Data present in the imported file must adhere to respective requirements for each field. `Name`, `Email` and `Phone` fields cannot be the same as other entries. If duplicate values exist, the command fails to complete and an error message is returned. There will be no changes made to the current AddressBook.</div>
   
**Step 4.** A new `AddressBook` is created, and updated it with the entries in the file. The current existing AddressBook is replaced with the newly created one. The display panel is updated to show the first entry present in the csv file.

**Step 5.** The updated AddressBook would be saved as per the process after the execution of a command.
The following sequence diagram shows how the import feature works:
![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)
   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
![ImportProcessData](images/ImportProcessData.png)

The reference frame for "Update GUI" is similar to the sequence diagram given in the section "Updating Info Panel Display", which can be found [here](#updating-info-panel-display).

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user uses the `import` command:
![ImportActivityDiagram](images/ImportActivityDiagram.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Design considerations:**

**Aspect: How the imported file is processed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Uses a header row to determine the data used**
    * Pros: No need to follow specific column ordering.
    * Cons: The names of the headers for the specific columns must be the exact name used (less case-sensitivity), and a header row must be present.

* **Alternative 2: Uses positioning of columns to import data**
    * Pros: No need for header rows.
    * Cons: Unable to ensure that the data is formatted in the correct order.

**Aspect: Making fields compulsory for import:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Only fields `Name`, `Contact Number`, `Residential Address`, `Email` and `Role` are compulsory**
    * Pros: Ensures that imported data have the minimum fields required before being imported, which most organizations should have.
    * Cons: Files cannot be imported if any entry has any of the compulsory fields missing.

* **Alternative 2: No compulsory fields**
    * Pros: Allows for multiple names for the fields in the header row, albeit still fixed. Files can be imported even if there are missing entries.
    * Cons:  Files can be imported regardless of any formatting issues or missing fields in entries, thus data can be imported even without any cleaning, making it harder to be used in the program.
   
* **Alternative 3 : All fields are compulsory**
    * Pros: Ensures data imported have all the required fields to utilise all the functionality of the program.
    * Cons: Files cannot be imported if any entry has any fields missing.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Updating Info Panel display

**Current Implementation** <br>
`InfoPanel` class controls the content being displayed on the Info Panel. The information to be displayed is dependent
on the ObservablePerson object `viewingPerson` in the ModelManager class. `viewingPerson` contains the person to be viewed, as well as
a `uiObserverList` that contains `UiObserver` that wish to be notified when the person to be viewed has been changed.

When the `viewingPerson` is changed, `InfoPanel`
should get updated automatically to display the new information.

This automatic updating of information to display on the Info Panel is achieved through the Observer pattern.

![InfoPanelClassDiagram](images/InfoPanelClassDiagram.png)

The following operations are implemented for the classes:
* `InfoPanel::updateInfoPanel(Person p)` - updates the content to be displayed on the Info panel with the new `Person`'s information.
* `ObservablePerson::addUiObserver(UiObserver observer)` - subscribes the `UiObserver` to the `ObservablePerson` to get updates when `ObservablePerson` changes
* `ObservablePerson::updateUi()` - updates the observers with the relevant `Person` information.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
On initialization:
1. `ObservablePerson` is created, and `InfoPanel` is initialized with the ObservablePerson passed as argument to the constructor
2. On creation of `InfoPanel`, it adds itself to the `uiObserverList` of the ObservablePerson to be subscribed for updates using `ObservablePerson::addUiObserver(UiObserver observer)`
   
When the `ObservablePerson` changes:
1. `InfoPanel` in the `uiObserverList` is updated with `ObservablePerson::updateUi()`
2. `InfoPanel` and other `UiObserver` in the list can then update their own Ui with the updated viewingPerson information passed to it.
   
Below is an example of how `InfoPanel` updates with a view command:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 1.** User executes `view 2` to view the 2nd employee in the list, and after the command is parsed, `v:ViewCommand` is being created.

**Step 2.** On execution of `ViewCommand`, `getPersonToView(index)` is called to get the personToView, and then passed to call `setViewingPerson(personToView)` on `Model`.

**Step 3.** Model calls `setPerson(personToView)` on `ObservablePerson`, causing it to update the viewing person. In the process of updating,
it informs the other `InfoPanel` in the `uiObserverList` to update, passing the new updated personToView to `InfoPanel`.

**Step 4.** With the new data passed to `InfoPanel`, it can then update the content to be displayed in however its `update()` method is implemented.  
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Design Considerations:**

Use Observer pattern to track when to update InfoPanel (Current Implementation)

**Pros:** `InfoPanel` can update by itself without `Model` having a dependency on the UI.

**Cons:** Might be harder to figure out what is "observing" the observable just by looking at the source code since there is no direct dependency.

**Alternative:**

Constantly update Info Panel with every command executed.

**Pros:** Easy to update, ensures that Ui is constantly updated.

**Cons:** Unnecessarily updates even when there is no change to data to be viewed, increases runtime.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Leave Balance

**Current Implementation**

Currently, leaves are represented by two attributes of `Person`: `LeaveBalance`, which represents the amount of leaves the employee has remaining, 
and `LeavesTaken`, which represents the leaves that the employee has taken on a given date.

`LeaveBalance` is internally represented as an integer value, and must have a value of at least 0 and at most 365.
The add to/deduct from leave balance features are implemented by the classes 
`AddLeaveBalanceCommand` and `DeductLeaveBalanceCommand` respectively.
Both classes extend `Command` with the following added method to get the updated person:
- `getUpdatedPerson(Person personToEdit)` - Returns a new `Person` object that is a copy of the input `personToEdit` object,
except with an updated `LeaveBalance` value.

Given below is an example of how `AddLeaveBalanceCommand` works.

**Step 1.** The user enters the command 'addLeaveBalance 2 l/1'. The `AddLeaveBalanceCommandParser` parses the input, creates a `AddLeaveBalanceCommand` object and executes it.
The command object contains two attributes: `index`, which corresponds to the input index of 2, and `leaveBalance` which corresponds to the input number of leaves, in this case 1.

**Step 2.** Inside `AddLeaveBalanceCommand#execute`, the list of all employees is retrieved by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

**Step 3.** Using the input `Index` value, the second person from the filtered list is retrieved as the `personToEdit` object.

**Step 4.** `AddLeaveBalanceCommand#getUpdatedPerson` is called, with `personToEdit` as an input.

**Step 5.** Inside `getUpdatedPerson`, `LeaveBalance#addLeaves` is called with the input `LeaveBalance` value as a parameter.

**Step 6.** `getUpdatedPerson` returns a copy of the `personToEdit` object with an updated `LeaveBalance`.

**Step 7.** The old `Person` object in the `Model` is then replaced with its updated copy using `Model#setPerson()`.

**Step 8.** `AddLeaveBalanceCommand#execute` returns a `CommandResult` to signal a successful execution.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how `AddLeaveBalanceCommand` works:

![AddLeaveBalanceSequenceDiagram](images/AddLeaveBalanceSequenceDiagram.png)

`DeductLeaveBalanceCommand` works similarly, except instead of calling `LeaveBalance#addLeaves` in step 5, `LeaveBalance#removeLeaves` is called.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Assigned Leaves

**Current Implementation**

`LeavesTaken` is internally represented as a `PriorityQueue` of `LocalDate` values. A `PriorityQueue` was chosen as it would 
automatically sort the `LocalDate` values from least to most recent after each add/remove date operation. 
There may be multiple `LocalDate` objects representing the same date. For example, if two employees have a leave on 2021-11-10,
each of them will have a different `LocalDate` object corresponding to 2021-11-10 inside their `LeavesTaken` attribute object.

The assign leave feature is implemented by the class `AssignLeaveCommand`.
This class extends `Command` with the following added method to get the updated person:
- `getUpdatedPerson(Person personToEdit)` - Returns a new `Person` object that is a copy of the input `personToEdit` object,
  except with updated `LeavesTaken` and `LeaveBalance` values.
  
`AssignLeaveCommand` works similarly to `AddLeaveBalanceCommand`, 
except instead of calling `LeaveBalance#addLeaves` , `LeavesTaken#addDate` is called. In addition,
`LeaveBalance#removeLeaves` is called with a `LeaveBalance` object containing the value 1. 
(In other words, assigning a leave deducts 1 leave from the leave balance.)

The remove outdated leaves feature is implemented by the class `RemoveLeavesBeforeCommand`.
This class extends `Command` with the following added method to get the updated person:
- `getUpdatedPerson(Person personToEdit)` - Returns a new `Person` object that is a copy of the input `personToEdit` object,
  except with an updated `LeavesTaken` value.

`RemoveLeavesBeforeCommand` works similarly to `AddLeaveBalanceCommand`,
except instead of calling `LeaveBalance#addLeaves` , `LeavesTaken#removeDatesBefore` is called.
In addition, `LeavesTaken#removeDatesBefore` is called for all `Person` objects in the filtered list.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how `RemoveLeavesBeforeCommand` works:

![RemoveLeavesBeforeSequenceDiagram](images/RemoveLeavesBeforeSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design considerations:**

**Aspect: How assigned leaves are represented**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Person` object has a `LeavesTaken` object that contains a set of `LocalDate` values that 
  corresponds to the employee's assigned leaves.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, able to delete individual `LocalDate` objects without needing to check other `Person` objects.
    * Cons: May have issues in regard to memory usage, as each unique date can potentially have many `LocalDate` objects that correspond to it.

* **Alternative 2:** Each unique date is represented by a `Leave` object.
    * Pros: Potentially more object-oriented, reduced memory usage as only one object is required for each date.
    * Cons: Need to keep track of how many `Person` objects are associated with each `Leave`, which might lead to increased coupling between `Leave` and `Person`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Aspect: How outdated assigned leaves are removed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Manually clear outdated leaves via a command (`removeLeavesBefore`).
    * Pros: Easier to implement and test than an automated solution, gives more control to the user in which leaves they want to clear.
    * Cons: Less convenience for the user, could lead to accidental deletion of certain leaves if the user makes a typo with the input date.

* **Alternative 2:** Assigned leaves will automatically clear themselves once the date has passed.
    * Pros: More convenient for the user.
    * Cons: Harder to test, and it could lead to unexpected behaviour. (e.g. What happens if the user changes their timezone, or if the user's system clock fails)
      Also, the user might want to keep a full record of all assigned leaves.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Start Payroll feature

**Current Implementation**

The start payroll feature is provided through `StartPayrollCommand`.
It extends `Command` with the following added methods to calculate the payroll for every employee:
- `StartPayrollCommand#calculatePay(HourlySalary salary, HoursWorked hoursWorked,
  Overtime overtime, OvertimePayRate overtimePayRate)` - Calculates the payroll based on the given parameters and
  returns a new `CalculatedPay` object.
- `StartPayrollCommand#createPersonWithCalculatedPay(Person personWithCalculatedPay,
  CalculatedPay newCalculatedPay)` - Creates a new `Person` that is a copy of the given `Person` parameter
  except with the updated `CalculatedPay` value.
- `StartPayrollCommand#createPersonWithZeroHoursWorkedAndOvertime(Person person)` - Creates a new `Person` that is a copy of the 
  given `Person` parameter except with the `HoursWorked` and `Overtime` values set to 0.

Given below is an example of how `StartPayrollCommand` works.

**Step 1.** The user enters the command word 'startPayroll'. The `addressBookParser` parses the input,
creates a `StartPayrollCommand` and executes it.

The following sequence diagram describes the operations in executing a `StartPayrollCommand`.

![StartPayrollSequenceDiagram](images/StartPayrollSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 2.** In the new instance of `StartPayrollCommand`, upon starting execution,
the list of employees to be viewed in `Model` is set to be unfiltered using `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`.
The list of all employees is then retrieved by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`,
storing a deep copy in `personList`.

**Step 3.** Each employee in the list of employees are checked if they have any previously calculated payroll that have not
been paid yet by calling `Person#isPaid()` on the employee. If an employee is unpaid,
a `CommandException` will be thrown.
   
**Step 4.** If there are no employees who are unpaid, calculations of payroll will proceed through the following substeps:

--Start of Calculating Payroll--

The following sequence diagram describes how the payroll is calculated.

**Step 4.1.** Retrieve the current `overtimePayRate` in the application from the `Model`
using `Model#getOvertimePayRate()`.
   
**Step 4.2.** Retrieve an employee from `personList`.
Retrieve the following attributes from the employee `Person` object:
- `hourlySalary` - The employee's salary per hour.
- `hoursWorked` - How many hours the employee has worked for (excluding overtime).
- `overtime` - How many hours of overtime the employee has worked for.

The new `CalculatedPay` object representing the calculated employee's pay is created by calling
the `StartPayrollCommand#calculatePay()` method, with the earlier retrieved values (`overtimePayRate`, `hourlySalary`,
`hoursWorked`, `overtime`) as parameters.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Step 4.3.** An updated copy of the employee `Person` object is created with the new `CalculatePay` attribute using
`StartPayrollCommand#createPersonWithCalculatedPay()`, and their `HoursWorked` and `Overtime` attributes reset to zero
using `StartPayrollCommand#createPersonWithZeroHoursWorkedAndOvertime()`. The updated copy of the employee is then
inserted into `calculatedPersonsList`.
   
Steps 4.2 and 4.3 are repeated for all employees in the `personList`.

**Step 4.4.** For every employee in `personList`, its corresponding `Person` object in the `Model` is then replaced 
with its updated copy in `calculatedPersonsList` using `Model#setPerson()`.

--End of Calculating Payroll--

**Step 5.** After every employee in the list has had their payroll calculated, HeRon is set to view the first employee 
in the list.

**Step 6.** Lastly, the `StartPayrollCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to signal successful execution.

**Design considerations:**

**Aspect: How the feature of calculating payroll is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** One command for calculating payroll for all employees.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to test (little variations in use cases).
    * Cons: Less flexible for users.

* **Alternative 2:** Command that calculates payroll for a single employee or all employees.
    * Pros: Provides more flexibility for users.
    * Cons: We need to check for which use case the user intends to use. Can be harder/more tedious to test
    as more there are more variations in use cases.
